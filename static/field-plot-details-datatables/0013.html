Each of these forest types was additionally stratified factorially across the EVEG attributes of `cover` and `tree size`. Within each of the resulting categories the field crew first attempted to survey the plots in Tier A, and if not possible, then moved to Tier B within the same vegetation category, and then to Tier C. Plots were selected to be within 1/4 mile of accessible roads and confirmed to have the desired forest cover through inspection of Google Earth imagery. A total of 51 plots were surveyed.","18-A-56"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"paging":false,"scrollY":"100%","dom":"t","bSort":false,"autoWidth":true,"columnDefs":[{"width":"40%","targets":0},{"name":"Attribute","targets":0},{"name":"Value","targets":1}],"initComplete":"function(settings, json) {\n$('body').css({'font-family': 'Arial'});\n}","order":[],"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":["options.initComplete"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
