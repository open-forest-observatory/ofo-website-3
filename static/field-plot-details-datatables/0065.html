Plots are located in mountainous regions throughout the state of California. Some trees were mapped recording a high-precision GPS point at each tree; others were mapped by measuring distance and azimuth from a series of subplot centers that create a contiguous block of subplots. Some plots use one method or the other; some plots use both. Derek Young computed the tree lat/lon for all trees mapped using distance/azimuth, including manual corrections by subplot to align subplots to one another based on drone-derived canopy height models.","Delta_3"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr><\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"paging":false,"scrollY":"100%","dom":"t","bSort":false,"autoWidth":true,"columnDefs":[{"width":"40%","targets":0},{"name":"Attribute","targets":0},{"name":"Value","targets":1}],"initComplete":"function(settings, json) {\n$('body').css({'font-family': 'Arial'});\n}","order":[],"orderClasses":false},"selection":{"mode":"multiple","selected":null,"target":"row","selectable":null}},"evals":["options.initComplete"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
