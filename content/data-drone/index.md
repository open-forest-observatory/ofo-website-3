We host a database of > 150 (and growing) drone-based forest imagery acquisitions, including raw images and downstream products including orthomosaics, canopy height models, and individual tree detections. A web catalog and API to access these datasets is in development. In the meantime, see our [listing of example datasets](https://docs.openforestobservatory.org/data/datasets/) available for download, and [contact us](/about/#contact-us) if you are looking for something specific.
