These workflows demonstrate the use of relevant OFO and third-party tools for drone-based forest mapping, from data collection, to production of forest maps, to accuracy assessment.

These workflows are in active development, with plans for a complete initial set by mid-2025. If you are looking for details that you can't find here, [reach out](/about/#contact-us)!

- [Data collection](data-collection) - Collecting drone data & ground reference data to support forest mapping at the individual tree scale
- [Photogrammetry](photogrammetry) - Processing drone data into geospatial datasets including orthomosaics, digital surface and terrain models, 3D mesh models, and point clouds
- [Tree detection & mapping](tree-detection) - Detecting and mapping individual trees using photogrammetry products
- [Taxonomic classification](taxonomic-classification) - Taxonomically classifying trees from drone imagery in a geospatial context
- [Accuracy assessment](accuracy-assessment) - Assessing the accuracy of drone-derived forest maps
  via comparison against ground reference data
