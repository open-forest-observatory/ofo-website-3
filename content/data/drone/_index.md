We host a database of > 150 (and growing) drone-based forest imagery acquisitions, including raw images and downstream products including orthomosaics, canopy height models, and individual tree detections. The collections thus far are focused on western U.S. conifer forests but also include a number of hardwood-dominated stands. The catalog is available for hosting forest imagery datasets globally, and we happily accept new contributions.

A web catalog and API to access these datasets is [in development](/data/drone/curation/). In the meantime, see our [listing of example datasets](https://docs.openforestobservatory.org/data/datasets/) available for download, and [contact us](/about/#contact-us) if you are looking for something else specific.
