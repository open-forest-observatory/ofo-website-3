[<i class="fa-regular fa-images"></i> **Drone-based data**](drone/) - We host a database of > 150 (and growing) drone-based forest imagery acquisitions, including raw images and downstream products including orthomosaics, canopy height models, and individual tree detections.

[<i class="fa-solid fa-tree"></i> **Ground reference data**](ground-ref/) - We host host a large dataset of > 150 traditional ground-based forest inventory plots with individual tree locations mapped. These datasets generally fall within the footprint of an OFO drone-based dataset, enabling calibration and validation of drone-based forest mapping workflows. [Access the catalog.](ground-ref/)

[<i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-list"></i> **Data collection protocols**](/workflows/data-collection/) - Guidance for collecting (and, we hope, contributing!) your own drone-based data and ground reference data.
