  <i class="fa-regular fa-images"></i> <strong>Drone-based data</strong>
</a>


 We host a database of > 150 (and growing) drone-based forest imagery acquisitions, including raw images and downstream products including orthomosaics, canopy height models, and individual tree detections. The data can be browsed in our <a href="/data/drone/">html map</a> or through our <a href="https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/#/external/stac.cyverse.org/">SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)</a>.

The data can also be accessed programmatically with python. Learn how [here](https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/stac?tab=readme-ov-file#access-ofo-data-with-python).

  <i class="fa-solid fa-tree"></i> <strong>Ground reference data</strong>
</a>

We host a large dataset of > 150 traditional ground-based forest inventory plots with individual tree locations mapped. These datasets generally fall within the footprint of an OFO drone-based dataset, enabling calibration and validation of drone-based forest mapping workflows. [Access the catalog.](ground-ref/)

 We have detailed protocols for collecting the drone and field data. Check out our methods and get guidance for collecting (and, we hope, contributing!) your own drone and field-based forest data.
