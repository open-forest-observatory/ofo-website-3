The Open Forest Observatory is a collaborative effort led by university researchers, with contributions and support from nonprofit groups, government agencies, and individuals.

We welcome new collaborators from all backgrounds! Visit our [community forum](https://github.com/orgs/open-forest-observatory/discussions) or [contact us](#contact-us) to get involved.

<br>


## Connect with us
We host virtual office hours where anyone can attend to get support on using our data and tools or to brainstorm ideas. Office hours are held on the first Wednesday of the month at 4PM PST and the third Wednesday of the month at 9AM PST. Both occur at this [zoom link](https://ucdavis.zoom.us/j/93441657477?pwd=zr5k5OSKrBFc8zZRraTHCqefd3HGgZ.1).

Visit our [community forum](https://github.com/orgs/open-forest-observatory/discussions) for discussion and help from OFO staff and fellow users. You can also sign up for our announcements [mailing list](https://lists.ucdavis.edu/sympa/subscribe/open-forest-observatory) to recieve announcements about new developments and any changes to scheduled office hours. We prefer to keep discussions public so that others can benefit, but you can also email OFO support directly at openforestobservatory@ucdavis.edu.
